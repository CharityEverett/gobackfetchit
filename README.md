# Go Back Fetch It

This project was one of the first AR storytelling experiences created, started back in 2017. It is a data storytelling project that mixes anthropology, geography, culture, and New Media Technology, graciously supported by the Open Documentary Lab at MIT, the Cambridge Arts Council, and the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard.
