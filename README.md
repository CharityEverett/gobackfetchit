# Go Back Fetch It

This project aims to create an Aframe WebXR framework for active data visualizations that run in browser, on mobile, and across XR devices. The first visualization is a spatial visualization of Africa wrapped around the moon to showcase the landmass that is 80% of the size of the moon. This can be used as a basis for comparing scales
